Sabrina is a Microbiology track undergrad in the Cell & Molecular Biology program, passionate about exploring microorganisms through the lens of mathematics and genetics. With over a decade of healthcare quality management experience and a strong interest in AI, she brings a unique interdisciplinary approach to biomedical research. Sabrina’s passion extends to One Health, where she studies the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, particularly the spread of infectious diseases between populations. By linking mutation rates and selection pressures to disease transmission dynamics, she aims to uncover insights that bridge microbiology, evolution, and public health. Outside of work and school, she’s a wildlife rehabilitator and shares her love for science through engaging and sometimes humorous TikTok content.

In the Fisk Lab, Sabrina currently works on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on EHR and biomedical papers to understand how physicans think about cancer and how it shapes treatment decisions.
