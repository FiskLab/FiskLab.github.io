# Fisk Lab @ URI's Website
## Please bear with us as the lab website is under-construction!
The Fisk Lab is a dry-lab at URI focused on using "basic science" methods from evolution, population genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics as tools for translational research.

We also pursue Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) for Computational Biology and are broadly interested in advancing pluralistic but evidence-based modes of teaching and learning.

We use computational biology to investigate the progression of human disease, especially cancer.

We work on a broad swath of projects both in the translational biosciences and in Discipline-Based Education Research.

The Fisk Lab is new--we have many collaborators, but no teammembers--yet! Feel free to reach out if you're interested in joining the team.
